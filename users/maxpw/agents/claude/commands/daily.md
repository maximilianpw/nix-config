# Daily Note

Log the user's daily note in their Obsidian vault.

## How it works

The user will tell you about their day — what they worked on, what they're thinking about, what's stuck, what clicked. They might give you a brain dump, a few bullet points, or just talk. Your job is to turn that into a clean daily note.

## Steps

1. **Listen** to what the user says. Let them finish their dump before reacting.

2. **Ask 1–2 clarifying questions** — but only when they'd actually sharpen the note. Skip this step if the dump is already rich. Good triggers:
   - A pivot or decision was mentioned but the *why* is missing → *"What changed your mind?"*
   - A blocker is implied but not named → *"What's stuck or waiting on someone?"*
   - The day sounds eventful but no realization surfaced → *"Anything click today?"*
   - No forward signal → *"What's the next concrete step?"*

   Hard cap: **two questions, max.** Don't run an interview. If the user's dump is thin on purpose ("just VEV stuff"), don't force depth — write little.

3. **Check if today's note exists** at `~/Documents/obsidian vault/001-DAILY/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}.md`.
   - If it exists, read it and **append** to the relevant sections (don't overwrite).
   - If not, create it from the template at `999-TEMPLATES/Daily.md`.

4. **Fill in the note.** Sections:
   - **What happened** *(always)* — factual, concise bullets. What was worked on, what got done, what didn't. Link to project notes (`[[100-PROJECTS/...]]`), wiki articles (`[[article-name]]`), or other daily notes where relevant. Keep it scannable.
   - **Thinking** *(always, but can be empty)* — reflections, realizations, hunches. Capture the user's voice, not your summary. Use their words when they said something insightful. Don't fabricate depth.
   - **Decisions** *(optional)* — explicit calls made today, each with a short *why*. Only include when a real decision was made — this section is for things worth revisiting later.
   - **Open questions** *(optional)* — things the user is chewing on but hasn't resolved. Great for surfacing tomorrow-you's starting point.
   - **Tomorrow** *(optional)* — one or two concrete next steps. Only include if the user mentioned them or answered the "what's next" ask-back.

   **Skip any optional section that would be empty.** Don't write "Decisions: none" — just omit it.

5. **Link context** — if the user mentions work related to a wiki topic, link to the relevant index (`[[index]]` in the topic folder). If they mention a project, link to the project folder. Don't over-link.

6. **Wiki flag** — if anything the user says sounds like it should be a wiki article (a realization about a technology, a pattern they figured out, a synthesis), mention it at the end: *"Worth filing to the wiki?"* Don't do it automatically.

7. **Show the user** the note content after writing so they can see what was captured.

## Rules

- Keep it short. A good daily note is 5–15 lines, not a novel. Adding optional sections doesn't mean making the note longer — it means giving the right content a home.
- Use the user's words and tone, not corporate-speak.
- Ask-backs are a scalpel, not a checklist. One or two, only when they'd improve the note.
- Skip empty sections. Never pad.
- If the user gives you very little ("just worked on VEV stuff"), write very little.
- If this is the second entry of the day, append cleanly — don't duplicate the header.
